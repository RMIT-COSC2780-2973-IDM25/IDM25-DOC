# Qualitative Comments from students

While universities use student feedback to judge the quality of a course and/or teacher (see [this](FAQ-COURSE.md#course-survey-experience-what-why) about that...), in my view, **the best use of such feedback is for the students themselves**! You say, _what?_ What I mean is that I believe it is very useful for _prospective students_ to know what previous fellow students have said about the course in general and the lecturer. This allows students considering taking the course to set their mind in the right way, judge if a course is suitable for them, plan ahead and prepare, and build accurate expectations. Basically, _would you recommend this course to a friend? If so, for which students would you recommend the course? Would you recommend the lecturer?_

While the university does not release the results to students, I personally share them for the above reasons. Note this is quite generous from me and I have no obligation to do it.

**DISCLAIMER:** please consider that feedback relates to various edition given, so some things may not apply anymore as the course usually changes from edition to edition (sometimes due to previous valuable feedback!). Also remember that each student is unique, so your situation, perspective, and aims, may be different from others: what others found amazing may be boring for you; and what others found horrible may not bother you or you may even like it!  However, **I hope you find it useful and it gives a sense of what to expect.**

Here we go...


## Responses to the Question: What are the best aspects of this course?

* Being shown real world implementations of what we are learning gives plenty of motivation to continue studying.
* I found the workshop sessions really effective.
* The teaching methods in this course are highly interactive and involve extensive hands-on practice, which greatly enhances the learning experience. Additionally, the teaching team is very responsive to questions on the forum, providing timely and helpful answers that support our understanding of the material.
* The weekly workshops and one on one sessions were very helpful as going through the workshop exercises with Sebastian's help was the best way to learn the content in my opinion. I think having the exercises be specifically about the content of that week with a clear connection to how they would be used in the assignment was also very effective (as opposed to spending time on content that was unrelated to assignment work). 
* I think the presentation requirement was also very effective, as it forced me to learn the content myself more thoroughly in order to be able to deliver it to the rest of the class.
* The workshop tasks are very useful in preparing us for the assignments, but they should be limited to 1 - 2 tasks as the workload is unreasonable. Sebastian puts in a lot of effort, so while his teaching style doesn't always suit me I greatly appreciate the effort he puts in. I also appreciate that he often seeks feedback and genuinely seems to think about suggestions even if he doesn't decide to implement them.
* The workshops in the first 7 weeks of the course get you familiar with the workflow needed for the first assignment. This made the first assignment far more enjoyable than most classes as it didn't feel like I needed to learn a new set of skills to start the assignment. Instead I just had to apply what I'd learnt to that point in a more complicated scenario. I also liked how the lesson structure in the second half of the course changed to suit the second assignment. 
* The workshops were fun to do and very helpful. The provided tests make it easy for me to iterate through solutions.
* This course is by far the most interesting programming course at uni, as you would never learn these concepts by doing self-study or side-projects. The guest speaker showed the practical applications of this which was interesting. Also the marked attendance helps a lot, otherwise people just skip class and it doesn't feel like uni anymore.
* This course was very good at keeping me interested. The material presented and the format it was presented in made it easy to engage with the course and want to discuss and learn.
workshop materials helped me get hands on with concepts early on


* The assignments were very well structured and led to increased understanding of the content. Especially assignment 2.
* The course introduced me into logic programming using prolog and asp(clingo), which I found was very helpful in solving problems in real world scenarios.
* The course provided a solid foundation in Answer Set Programming and Prolog, which are essential tools for intelligent decision making. The hands-on exercises and practical applications helped in understanding these languages effectively.
* The resources and materials looks good. The communication to students was too good through a third party platform.
* Workshop structure greatly aligned with learning goals


* I have a different way of thinking now
* Reading resources and videos are already provided.
* Sebastians a great teacher. Pretty harsh marker but i'd prefer that than a boring teacher who's lenient.
students are good, class helping each other learn well.
* The best aspect of this course was being different from a typical coding course. Rather than using basic programming practices, I learned a new way of solving problems. This course is a must as it may not have a big market but still may come in handy in the future!
* The course helps us understand a new realm of programming for AI. As the name suggests, (Intelligent Decision Making) is about building the right intuition to approach problems.
* The course is well structured. We started from basics and went all the way to advance level concepts in declarative programming.
* The teacher is really passionate about the subject and works hard to give some exercises to implement the things that we learned in the class
* Use of github classroom is very nice, repos are quite well documented with very little ambiguity on assignments. Assessed items are marked fairly, and discussion of marking again is made easy using github comments - i liked this a lot. The content is demanding but achievable. the two main assignments are both constructed in a way where students can stretch themselves if desired.  unlike a lot of other courses, i feel like what i have learned will stay with me and could potentially be useful in the future.
* I enjoyed learning a completely new style of programming which works in a completely different fashion to what i have previously done
* Sebastian is great at explaining the idea of the knowledges we are taught in the course. The face to face interaction between the students and Sebastian is outstanding, everyone is encouraged to share about their thoughts and ideas during discussion.

* Asp and prolog are really good languages to learn
* He is teaching several advanced programming languages, which appear to be quite valuable, particularly the optimisation techniques that he taught can be utilised in a variety of domains. His teaching techniques are outstanding.
* Interesting and unique coursework, with lots of opportunities to ask questions and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
* One session a week   Student presentations are insightful and educational
* The interaction in class is very good. Professor gave few good examples to understand.
* The Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming paradigms covered in this course are unlike anything I encountered during my undergrad or professional life. It has already helped me to think about problems in new ways, and will be a worthy addition to my skill set.  I enjoyed the presentations from other students, as well as the opportunity to practice my own presentation skills in front of a friendly audience. Spacing these presentations over the duration of the course was also much more effective than cramming them into a single long session, which can feel both rushed for the speakers and draining for the audience.  The weekly workshop exercises are effective knowledge building blocks. I absolutely adore the autograder style self-assessment, where small progress leads to incremental success. It is so motivating and satisfying to see the GitHub build "go green".  With regards to class scheduling, I was surprised to discover that I actually appreciated the 3 hour workshop in the evening. It helped me to balance other commitments, and allowed me to focus and stay organised.  Sebastian is very passionate and deeply knowledgeable about the content, as well as an engaging and effective communicator. Despite being the only assigned teaching staff member for the course, he was extremely responsive on the forums.
* the things are totally different from the previous programming language, which is interesting.
* the way of teaching is very good
* This courses teaches programming paradigms that are not main stream but are very useful.
* Timetabling: one 3-hour class that combines lecture with tutorial
* Unique content delivery



## Responses to the Question: What aspects of this course are in most need of improvement?


* 1.Solve some problems in the class is a must. 2. Teach how to approach a problem. 
* Few exercises even though effort is needed carries very low marks. A students effort is not valued much.  * Sebastian is really a friendly person in class, but not at all times, I feel like he doesn't understand a students actually difficulties at times. 
* The marking for each assignment is too strict, it's good that he expects great solutions, but what I feel is it's a bit harsh on students sometimes. 
* Even though the course itself was good, it was tough catching up with weekly workshops. Also, sice this subject is only offered during even semesters that too with 2 other core subjects it was too tough to manage time evenly.
* Nothing, Seb is good, but it is for sure difficult course
* Some course materials and specifications could benefit from clearer and more concise language.
* The marking criteria for the assignments were quite strict.
* Use the official RMIT provided platforms, rather than Ed and google forms for everything. 


* A little bit more explicit instruction for the second assignment would have been helpful, however team catchups with teachers were available for booking.
* I like the required student presentations, but they are often very dry, I'm not sure what could be done about this though.
* I personally think its pretty spot on, nothing to change really.
* I understand the point of the student lead presentations and do see value in them for the presenter, however they take up such a large part of each week and many of them offer little learning value for the viewers. It actually de-incetivised me from doing the readings each week as most presentations copied directly from the book without adding much. I would recommend either limiting each presentation to 5 minutes, or having students submit video presentations that can be watched as an extra resource prior to class. As many presentations are so theory heavy and take up a lot of class time, there is a bit of a disconnect between the theory and the practical, often when we get to the workshop tasks we are yet to a see a single example of how a predicate is written let alone used. Personally, I best understand the theory through frequent links to the practical where we are able to apply and reinforce our theoretical understanding.
* More flexible time tabling options would be nice. The only available option runs late at night and a 3-hour workshop session during the night is very tiring.
* When a new aspect is introduced Sebastian should go through one or two code examples with the entire class before letting everyone do all the workshop questions by ourselves.


* my two criticisms of the course are the slightly ambiguous participation grade, and the lack of content on the mechanics 'behind the scenes' with prolog and asp.  i would prefer to have weekly quizes that are assessed. Also, despite doing many of the tutorials myself, I feel like there would be more motivation to do them if they had some small course weighting added to them - again maybe they do have some participation weighting - but again its ambiguous.  the second improvement suggestion is adding more details on the mechanisms happening behind the scenes with prolog and asp, i.e. how the computer is literally executing the logic. This was done fairly well with prolog and the concepts of backtracking - but could definitely be improved. ASP in particular i feel like i would have benefited from an explanation from the teacher with a slide deck explaining the basic concept with examples.
* Sebastian should work on explaining better, he never gives straight answer, he gives big round explanation for simple yes or no questions that never answer the actual question, its very frustrating. The course should have a tutor maybe to connect with the students better.
* The only problem with this course is the lack of good and simple technical examples because the concept of "Answer Set Programming" is still not that popular and lacks resources. Sebastian is great at teaching and if he could provide videos of his own where examples (other than map-coloring and sudoku) are being explained, it would be a great help. He is a good teacher and his own materials will be better than most!
* This course can have 2 short assignments and 1 big project to better grasp both prolog and ASP concepts.
* Too much content in a short time.
* Would like the lecturer, to mandate the completion of more simple exercises weekly. Right now it's self-driven, would have been better if it was made mandatory.
* This course should be advertised more often to encourage people to join.
* Initially, the course content was overwhelming. As the concepts are quite novel, it was exceptionally difficult to get started and gave me a feeling of inadequacy that took a long time to recover from. I believe the problem stems from the fact that we are given access to reading material and workshop exercises, but then essentially instructed to figure things out for ourselves. I can appreciate that Sebastian's preference towards "production learning" as opposed to "consumption learning" is well-intentioned, with a desire for better student learning outcomes. With that said, I strongly recommend introducing some degree of demonstration into the curriculum, at least in the early stages of the course (the first couple of weeks). I do not suggest this to simply make the course easier, and I genuinely believe you will get more out of your students if you take a more "hand holding" approach to the starter concepts.  There is a lot of assigned reading, more than a student could realistically commit to on a weekly basis. It would be helpful to reflect on what is genuinely required and optional reading, and more clearly delineate to assist students with prioritising the most important content. The students with sufficient capacity and passion will explore all of the content anyway.  The course needs another tutor for a face-to-face workshop of this size. Sebastian has been doing his best to attend to all students during the session, but seems to be spread too thin. It is difficult to obtain assistance during the workshop, and when the opportunity finally arrives the encounter feels rushed. Some students also monopolise these interactions.
* It is becoming more and more common for individuals from diverse educational and professional backgrounds to study AI and implement AI techniques in their specific fields. Consequently, people with various backgrounds are enrolling in AI courses at RMIT. However, the grading system employed in this particular course is quite hard. No partial mark is given for attempted solutions. Moreover, this course offers limited flexibility. Quizzes are administered in every class session, whereas it would have been preferable to have them spaced out over a three-week interval. Although workshops are valuable for learning and skill development, they may pose challenges for full-time students, especially those without a computer science and engineering (CSE) background.
* Mnay things i would say. 1.I know its a masters course, but professor doesn't help us with assignments or give any good tips on it. 2. I feel like professor should consider the weak learners as well when giveing tasks or helping with assignments. 3. Not everyone is an expert at all times, so people should get good help from the professors. 4.The assignment marking system is the worst i would say. Its too unfair, when we work hard for each assingments. The marking scheme or rubric should be a bit lenient.
requires more than expected time to complete the assignments and requires more commitment per week than expected
* The amount of work required to be performed outside of class is significant. More guidance to help solve workshop problems would be appreciated
* There should be a way to gauge our performance in the assignments, a lot of students were shocked when receiving a really bad mark although it appears to be working locally.
too much reading is required. it is hard to balance the time-cost of each course.
too much time need to spent for this course
* Tutorials aren't helpful. You never feel like you have learnt something. Being advised to figure things out yourself without looking up outside material is not helpful. You just feel like you are constantly going up against a brick wall. You could spend hours trying to work out a problem only to find the solution was no where near what you imagined. Why can't they provide actual tutorial material that builds your skills up or extends on foundational knowledge instead of throwing you in the deep end and hoping that you figure it out.   Workshop setting where you can interact with other students is fun. You need to provide markers and access to whiteboards and encourage students to work through problems together. Not the siloed mentality where we each have to figure things out ourselves. What's the point of coming to the classroom for that?  No online recording. If you get sick you get left behind.
