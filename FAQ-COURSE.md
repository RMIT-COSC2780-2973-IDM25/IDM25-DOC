# ADMINISTRATION

## Why this FAQ?

This question is already answered in the first question in this [FAQ](FAQ-COURSE.md). ;-)

If, somehow, you managed to get out of the [self-reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference), then this is the list of usual questions that are asked about the course. A FAQ like this one can help you find answer to common questions right away. Also, by having an FAQ I am able to provide consistent and uniform answers to everyone. Some questions that can shed some light on the rationale of certain policies or approaches to the course.

Of course, if you cannot find your question here, then you are invited to post it in the discussion forum. As questions become more common or usual, I add them to this list. So, maybe your new question can make it to the list! :-)


## Communication policy: I have a question, can I email you?

**Communication/email policy:** Except for personal issues, all electronic communication must be directed to the [EdStem Discussion Forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/22051). I only use email for limited communications regarding **personal circumstances** (in which case email is just used to arrange a face-to-face meeting). In particular, I will not respond by e-mail to any requests to clarify lecture, tutorial, or assignment questions. Please use workshops first, and discussion forum second, for all such questions so that a _fair course is run_ and all other fellow students can benefit as well. Do not be afraid to post any question (of course, as long as it is a proper question: just asking for “help” or providing solutions/insights on assignments is not acceptable, as it may amount to plagiarism), no question is stupid! To benefit from others, then, please ensure that you _regularly check_ the course website and attend lectures and tutorials.

Check [Course Communication Policy here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qUcAW0J1Oq0Aa5VKJBYikUWnKSzdnI-/view?usp=sharing)

## Attendance: do I need to attend workshops?

**YES!** This is a _research-oriented seminar-style_ advanced course, which means it requires on campus attendance to workshops. This is already specified in the [Course Overview](http://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/COSC29732410):

> Being a seminar-style course, students are expected to prepare for and actively participate in-person in class via discussions, presentations, and exercises (worth 20% marks overall). Thus, while a minimum attendance standard is not compulsory, non-attendance may seriously jeopardise participation marks. 

Workshops are not lectures where the instructor delivers the content. Instead, we discuss together each week content at workshops, we do presentations, execute drills, etc. So, on campus personal presence is necessary. Also, a component of the assessment is assigned to _participation_ during workshops, presentation, and leadership. To participate actively will surely require being there. :-)

In addition, workshops will be the place to discuss your projects/assignments and doubts about them. The course will have a small set of students, which makes it a perfect environment for participation and sharing of knowledge, ideas, and opinions!  So, we strongly suggest attending ALL workshops in person. The discussions, exchanges, and support opportunities done in the workshop will not be duplicated elsewhere.

Note that there is only 1 workshop session of 3hrs, and late in the day.

## I work outside and have other commitments, should I take this course?

If you cannot make it to the workshops, then we recommend you look for alternative courses that you can indeed attend or can be taken without attendance (or you don't have a clash so you can attend). A major distinctive feature of this course is the in-person work during the 3hrs weekly workshop, and the contributions and work in each workshop do count towards your participation marks, and it is where the learning is supported.

## Can I attend in-person workshops remotely?

No. RMIT is committed to on-campus experience and there is no hybrid teaching for this course. In any case, given the interactive nature of this course, this wouldn't make any sense for this particular course.

Please refer to [this question](#attendance-do-i-need-to-attend-workshops).

## Will there be workshops recordings?

No. All will be in-person and highly interactive. It wouldn't make any sense anyways, but since students will drive the sessions we wouldn't record them even if for privacy and non-exposure reasons.

## What are the dates for this semester?

Here is the [Academic Calendar for 2025](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/important-dates/2025/he).

## Course Survey Experience: what? why?

The **usefulness of student course surveys** has been the subject of **much debate** in the academia and whether it is a useful tool to improve the quality of teaching or just a mechanism that leads _lower teaching standards_ (and _grade inflation_ ). If you want to read more about this debate, see the articles I posted at the bottom.

The fact is that the Course Survey is **used to evaluate us, academic staff, in our teaching**. It is possibly the main evaluation source. The Course Survey gives, in the end, a_"Good Teaching Score" (GTS), from 1 (bad) to 5 (perfect). The **average across is around 4.10**.

In the survey, each answer is a score between _1 (strongly disagree)_ an _5 (strongly agree)_, **but only scores 4 and 5 are considered positive feedback towards the score.** What is more, given that the average score is already above 4, providing 4 or less is signaling a "below average" score.

Nevertheless, regardless of how student feedback is used by Universities, in my view, **the best use of student feedback is for the students themselves**! What I mean is that it is very useful for prospective students to know what previous fellow students have said about the course in general and the lecturer. This allows students to set their mind in the right way, plan ahead and prepare, and build accurate expectations. Basically, _would you recommend this course to a friend? Would you recommend the lecturer?_ _While the results are generally not given to students, **_I personally show my previous results for my courses_**. [Here is for this course](FAQ-REVIEWS.md).

I particular, **I am very interested in the feedback** of those who have participated in the course actively, by attending lectures, tutorials, using the web page, etc. **Your contribution is very meaningful for future students, so help them out! :-)**

### Some links on the topic

Now, there has been a lot of debate whether these surveys are a good idea, or if in the end, they backfire in terms of education, as academics give in to the temptation of providing easier and easier courses to avoid negative feedback, thus causing grade inflation and poor learning outcomes. As promised, some essays on the issue and problems of student course surveys, for those of you who are interested (which I hope are many!). The article [Student Course Evaluations Get An 'F'](http://tinyurl.com/nxsmyc4) is very interesting and reports on some findings:

> "_Here's what he found. The better the professors were, as measured by their students' grades in later classes, the lower their ratings from students._"

> _"If you make your students do well in their academic career, you get worse evaluations from your students," Pellizzari said. Students, by and large, don't enjoy learning from a taskmaster, even if it does them some good._

> "_There's an intriguing exception to the pattern: Classes full of highly skilled students do give highly skilled teachers high marks. Perhaps the smartest kids do see the benefit of being pushed._"

> "_Measuring the teacher by how well the student did in the next course is an important part of this experiment. Previous papers, says Pellizzari, compared student ratings to student grades within that same course. An easy-A prof may earn five stars in return for handing out good grades. But this leniency, his research suggests, does the students no long-term favors._"


Two more articles with findings on the issue are:

1. [_Zero Correlation Between Evaluations and Learning - New study could be another nail in the coffin for the validity of student evaluations of teaching_](http://tinyurl.com/hdd7979) 
2. [_Students don't know what's best for their own learning_](https://theconversation.com/students-dont-know-whats-best-for-their-own-learning-33835). This article in The Conversation from a couple of years ago cites studies that show *negative* correlation between student evaluation and learning.

I think as a University student and future graduate, you should know about all this, be interested, and form your own informed opinion. _Your journey at uni should be much more than collecting credits and learning predicate logic!_ **_Enjoy it!_**

## I want to discuss something face-to-face, can I?

Workshops are the best place for this course, I am there 3 hours. If you need privacy (e.g., discuss personal matters), then please send me an email and we will arrange an appointment in my office, no problem!

## I am enrolled in COSC2973 (UGRD) but my Canvas says COSC2780 (PGRD). Is everything OK?

Yes, no need to worry. This is just a Canvas "hack" for cross-listed courses. We maintain only one site (COSC2780's one), but everybody in the course can access it. No problem, come and enjoy! ;-)

## I enrolled late in the course, can you explain me about X, Y, and Z about the course? What should I do now?

First of all, I assume you have discussed your late enrollment with your Program Manager. This is important. We assume students have been diligent beforehand and are fully ready and enrolled at least in Week 0, if not before.

Enrolling late means that you have lost content and information about the course, and possibly assessments. This is fine as long as you **got the OK of your Program Manager** and you take **full responsibility** of your late entering to the course, _without shifting the burden to the teaching staff_.

Think about it: joining a course in week 2 or 3 is like getting 15' late to a meeting with lots of people: you do it with care, trying not to bother others, and assuming _full responsibility_ for having arrived "late". Would you stop the meeting and ask: _"can you please tell me what you have been discussing so far?"_ Surely not... ;-)

So this means that:

1. The teaching staff will not go over the course logistics and information on a per-student basis when the student has joined the course late (and lost the first week of information and course overview).
   - This means you would have to gather the information provided in the first weeks by yourself, by reading the online course pages/information, parsing all relevant forum posts, watching the videos and recordings. You would probably benefit from talking to other fellow students who are in sync with the course.
   - Please, do not ask the teaching staff to go over the course details _again_, but if you have to, please do it _after_ you have processed everything and do it _in person_ in lectorials, tutorials, consultation time. This would show that you really care and put a legitimate effort to catch-up (and hence the teaching staff will be more sympathetic). :-)
2. You will have to catch-up with the technical content of the course.  This is an intense course and there is significant reading allocated to each week, starting from week 1 itself. This means you would have to put significant effort to sync with the course.
   - Entering in week 2+ should be doable with effort; after that would be very challenging and risk.
3. You are not entitled to any extension or re-do of assessments run or distributed already when you enrolled.

In summary, the course is very intense, even for those starting on time, and every week matters. I am OK if you join late after discussing with your PM, as long as you **take full responsibility** of such late start. Of course I am also OK with students contacting me before formally enrolled and while they are waiting for administrative process to conclude; this will allow students to stay in sync with the course until all paper-work is sorted out.

Hope this is clear and all the best in the course!

## I have a clash with other courses, what should do?

I do not manage that aspect, please refer to the timetabling FAQ: https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/my-course/class-timetables/faqs

The most relevant question is this:  _I have two classes that clash. What can I do?_

For higher education students: 

> Class times are selected to ensure core course options are clash-free, but it’s not possible to cater for every elective option or non-standard enrolment, for example when taking courses from different year levels from your program. If you have an unavoidable tutorial, workshop, or lab clash, you should discuss your enrolment with your School or your Program Coordinator.

In this context, “Program Coordinator” = Program Manager

## I have a question about the course, but it is not here!

If you have any questions about the course that you think other fellow students may be also interested in learning, please post it in the forum!

# COURSE GENERAL

## Is this course theoretical or practical?

**Both!** I would say that it is ~70% practical and ~30% theoretical. There will be significant programming, but not in classical "mainstream" programming languages like Java or Python. Instead, you will learn to do constraint programming in declarative logic and constraint-based programming languages. These languages build on top of theoretical notions and frameworks, like _logic_ and _set theory_. Thus, we will talk about formulas, constraints, variables, models, satisfiability, etc.

## What programming languages are used?

It depends on the edition. For 2024 we will use [SWI-Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) and [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) Answer Set Programming. We will also use Python.

Note that you are not meant to know these non-standard languages: it is one of the aims of the course that you learn them! :-)

## Are assignments individual or in groups?

There will be several individual assessments (including a programming assignment) as well as major group project.

## What is the overall difficulty of the topics?

It is hard to answer this question, as it will depend a lot on the background, motivation, and dedication of each student.

However, one could argue that the course is more towards the challenging/difficult spectrum because:

1. It is an *advanced course*, expected to be taken by postgraduate students and last year (good) undergraduate students.
2. It deals with *abstract mathematical concepts*, like logical models and formulas, recursion and self-reference, complex and infinite objects.
3. It requires *problem solving skills* to solve combinatorial decision making problems.
4. It requires *self-driven attitude*: there is significant pre-reading before workshops. It is not a classical undergraduate course where the instructors yields all the knowledge during the session.
5. It is run by a *demanding teacher* who pushes students hard. :-)

One initial test is to read Part I.1 and I.2 (Sets & Logic) in the Book of Proofs:

https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/

and see how it goes. If you don't feel comfortable with that, then this may be a signal :-)

Another objective reference of difficulty could be the grade distribution. In general, the course has had 15/20% HDs and ~20/25% NN. So, it is hard to get an HD and if one doesn't do the work to a good standard it is easy to fail it. :-)

In general, if you are looking for a course to that is not too demanding (maybe because you are already taking difficult courses in the semester), then this may not be a good choice. However, if you have motivation and time space to dedicate, I suspect you may learn a way of thinking and solving programs that you have never been exposed to before.

Nonetheless, you are happy to come to chat with me and we can discuss your _own case_. Please drop by my office or send me an email for an appointment; I am usually in my office available on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Come!

## What is the relation of this course with COSC1125/1127 Artificial Intelligence Course?

Basically this is one sub-topic of the AI course expanded into a whole course. Thus we go much much deeper. This means that if you had taken (and passed!) AI before, then you will probably understand many things much faster. The natural progression is AI (general course) --> IDM.

# DISCUSSION FORUM & FORUM ETIQUETTE

Please see dedicated [Forum FAQ & Etiquette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HdrY91LIPRZOEni_jsCwmN8Oc8MrUzljen6qHzbtQeU/edit?usp=sharing) for the forum.

# WORKSHOP

## Are attendance to the workshop mandatory?

Yes! This is a seminar-style course and thus requires on campus attendance; check [this question](#attendance-do-i-need-to-attend-workshops-2).

## But I cannot book my sessions, it says it is full; should I do?

There is only one session for this course of 3hrs, just come… :-)

## When are lecture slides made available?

There are no lectures in this course. Face-to-face sessions are interactive workshops where we will all be discussing the topic of the week.

## When are lecture/workshop recordings available?

Being an interactive student-driven workshop, there is no recordings for the sessions. As stated in [this question](#attendance-do-i-need-to-attend-workshops-2), attendance is expected to every workshop (only once per week).

In any case, there is no classical “lecture” delivered by the instructor as in other courses, and we do not record student presentations, as they are assessment and not material for release in the "wild".

## So, when & where are the workshops?

They will be carried out on Wednesdays 5:30pm - 8:30pm in room 80.06.05.

## I cannot attend my workshop session, can I change to another session?

There is only one workshop session for this small course. If you are taking this course, please make sure you are available at workshops, that is indeed “the core of the course”.

## Should I bring my laptop to the workshops?

**Definitively!** Yes, please make sure you bring your laptop, the course will run in BOYD (bring your own device) mode. We will be doing practical hands-on work in workshops, so it is important you are able to execute them.

# ASSESSMENTS

## I was never asked these questions!

This is correct and one of the objectives of the course’ assessments. This is an advanced, Master-level, course and hence we assess at the highest level of the [Bloom Hierarchy](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/) (_evaluate, create_) so as to achieve higher-order levels of learning for applying and creating new solutions.

At this level, one important skill---a very important one---is to be able to handle new problems and challenges with the knowledge & problem-solving strategies you gathered earlier and to demonstrate autonomy and self-driven process. It is not enough to *just* solve questions that you have seen before. In particular, if you want to excel, you must be able to welcome & handle novel challenges.

## Can I ask questions on an assignment/assessment in the forum?

Of course, but please check the document _"[Posting about assessments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HdrY91LIPRZOEni_jsCwmN8Oc8MrUzljen6qHzbtQeU/edit#heading=h.nj8m4hp7jeo2)"_ to make sure you are doing it in the appropriate way.

## Are assessments individual or team-based?

Both. There will be individual component assessment components (participation, presentation, assignment project 1) as well as a team-based assessment (course project).

## Can I do the assessments without going to class?

Some yes, but some not. You will certainly work outside class on your Programming assignments and projects, though there will also be time during workshops to work on them and get support from the teacher.

However other assessments in the course will require being in-person, such as preparation/participation quizzes, participation in discussions, presentations, and workshop exercises. These will also be available to students participating in-person in the class. Please refer to the [Attendance: do I need to attend workshops?](#attendance-do-i-need-to-attend-workshops) question.

## Academic Integrity? What is that?

Since this is an advanced course, we assume students are very knowledgeable about academic integrity and that nobody in the course will engage in dishonest behaviour in any form or shape.

Said so, here are some resources:

* [RMIT Academic Integrity student resources](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/student-essentials/assessment-and-exams/academic-integrity) to learn more about academic integrity
* [RMIT Learning Advisors online](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/study-support/study-support-hub) provides a contact if you require further support or advice.

RMIT’s Student Conduct policy requires that students abide by the academic integrity expectations set out in the:

* [Student Charter](https://policies.rmit.edu.au/download.php?id=74&version=1&associated), and
* [Statement of Student Responsibilities](https://policies.rmit.edu.au/download.php?id=75&version=1&associated).


## In a code assignment/project, how do I make sure I do not go against academic integrity?

Good one! This deserves its own separate answer [here](CODE-INTEGRITY.md).


## I am very busy with other commitments (work, other subjects, travel, etc.) and may not be able to make the deadline, can I get a 2-3 day extension?

We have 200+ students and therefore lots of students could claim time constraints for multiple reasons. Besides the unmanageable workload that this would imply (reviewing and tracking each case, marking them at different times, different releases, etc.), I am _not able/allowed to arbitrarily judge_ which cases are OK and which ones are not: I would undoubtedly be making mistakes and hence treating students differently, _which can put me in a very risky situation due to fairness issues_.

So, extensions are reserved to _extreme cases that are totally outside the control of the student_, such as health issues.

We expect students enrolled in the course to _have arranged all their other commitments_ (e.g., work, courses, family, trips, etc.) beforehand to make sure they can carry out the course _under the planned schedule_.

Also, we note that the difficulty of each assessment has been planned to be achievable within the time-frame, so claims about the difficulty of the task will not be entertained wrt extensions. Pushing one deadline for many students will not only complicate the execution of the course, but will put students in a more difficult situation for upcoming (more demanding) assessments.

Finally, because of the nature of project assessments and the quick release of results, any SPC will probably be in the form of an **Equivalent Assessment**, that is, another _ assessment later on that will assess the same content but possibly in a different way. In most cases this will involve a pre-arranged in-person 1-2hrs closed-book assessment with the instructor (e.g., a set of exercises to complete).

## Can I submit late? What is the penalty?

Yes, for assignment projects only (not timed and timetabled assessments), you can submit late with, albeit with a penalty. Assignment projects received late and without prior extension approval or special consideration will be penalised by a deduction of 10% of the total score possible per calendar day late for that assessment.

Please note that late submissions are only allowed to assignments and projects, not for timed and timetabled assessments (e.g., in class quizzes, challenge exercises, or take-home exercises). These must be done during the time-frame allowed and no late submission is permitted.

## What is the policy on Special Consideration (SPC)?

The dates of all assessments in this course are given well in advance. Plan early your work around your commitments and workload, start on the assessments early, and submit them substantially before the deadline, preferably at least one or two days before. Submitting close to the deadline could be risky and you may fail to submit on time, for example due to loss of Internet, laptop problems, server delays, heavy workload, late enrolment, external commitments, etc

However, if you know you will be unable to complete an assignment due to illness or personal circumstances outside of your control, please contact your lecturer immediately for special consideration. Evidence will be required. In many cases, though, I cannot grant unilateral special considerations and you may need to go through RMIT formal process for [Special Consideration (SPC)](http://www.rmit.edu.au/students/specialconsideration).

Each request will be considered on an individual basis. If the request is approved, the deadline for the assignment will be extended. If the request is denied and the assessment missed, you will unfortunately receive a 0 for that assessment.

Please note that while no SPC will be granted frivolously, any request received close to the assessment date (or after the date!) will generally not be accepted except in the most extreme circumstances. This is to encourage students to plan days and weeks ahead, and to discourage last minute pleas for help.


## I have a SPC for a project, how does it work?

It depends. If the SPC provides a short extension (less than a week), then you will just need to submit under the new (extended) deadline.

If however the SPC cannot be granted under a short extension, then the assessment will be carried out as an _Equivalent Assessment_. An Equivalent Assessment covers the same content and at the same expectations, but can be done in a different format. In most cases, an Equivalent Assessment will involve solving a set of precise exercises on paper with the instructor on campus. The instructor will set the date/time and location and the student must make sure they are made themselves available for it.
